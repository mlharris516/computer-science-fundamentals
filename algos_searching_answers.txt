Short Answer

1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

Find an listing in a phone book.

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

Find a book in a library, each book can be found by the row, and exact point in the dewey decimal system.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

seven iterations

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

three iterations

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

Linear, because a binary search cannot work wiht an unsorted collection.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

Binary search, because from the beginning, the first iteration could eliminate half a million items, and each iteration would keep eliminating large chunks of items, making it a much faster process than a linear search.


Programming Assignment

1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

//without notes

let words = ["Aardvark", "Aid", "Albatross", "Bingo", "Bongo", "Cut", "Detail", "English"];

function dictionarySearch(arr, word){ 
  var low = arr[0];
  var high = arr[arr.length -1];

  while (low < high) { 
    var mid = (arr.indexOf(low) + arr.indexOf(high)) / 2; 
    mid = Math.round(mid); 
    
    if(arr[mid] > word) { 
      high = arr[mid -1]; 
    } 
    else if (arr[mid] < word) { 
      low = arr[mid + 1];
    }
    else { 
      return arr[mid];
    }
  }
  return "Word not found";
}

console.log(dictionarySearch(words, "Albatross"));


//with notes

let words = ["Aardvark", "Aid", "Albatross", "Bingo", "Bongo", "Cut", "Detail", "English"];

function dictionarySearch(arr, word){ 
  var low = arr[0]; //set low to index of first item in collection
  var high = arr[arr.length -1]; //set high to last item in collection

  while (low < high) { //loop will run as long as low is less than high
    var mid = (arr.indexOf(low) + arr.indexOf(high)) / 2; //find the midpoint of the collection
    mid = Math.round(mid); //get rid of decimals
    
    if(arr[mid] > word) { //if the midpoint is larger than the word looking for
      high = arr[mid -1]; //set high to one less than the midpoint to ignore upper half
    } 
    else if (arr[mid] < word) { //if the midpoint is less than the word looking for
      low = arr[mid + 1]; //set low to one greater than the midpoint to ignore the lower half
    }
    else { //if the midpoint is neither greater than or less than the word looking for, it must be equal value
      return arr[mid];
    }
  }
  return "Word not found";
}

console.log(dictionarySearch(words, "Albatross"));

2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.


var fishTank = ["Gold", "White-Spotted", "Snail", 
			"Bug-Eyed Gold"];

function findFish(arr, target){
  for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    if (arr[i] === target){
      return "White-Spotted Goldfish found";
    }
  }
  return "White-Spotted Goldfish not found";
}

console.log(findFish(fishTank, "White-Spotted"));
