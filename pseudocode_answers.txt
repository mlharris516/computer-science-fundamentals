Short Answer

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
    To work through what you want the function/algorithm to do, written in a way that is easier for you to read while working on it.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
    It would have an error, and wouldn't be able to run.

Programming Assignment

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

    INPUT first number
    INPUT second number
    IF the first number is greater than the second number
        RETURN first number
    ELSE IF the first number is less than the second number
        RETURN second number
    ELSE 
        RETURN "the numbers are equal"
    END IF


2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

    INITIALIZE total to zero
    SET counter to zero
    WHILE the counter is less than or equal to 100
        INPUT first number
            PRINT first number
        ADD one to the counter
    END WHILE


3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.


    INPUT array of phone numbers and names
    FUNCTION 
        SET iteration to 0 
        FOR entry that is less than the length of the phonebook variable
        INPUT interation
        END FOR 
        IF array is equal to entry
            PRINT entry at iteration
            RETURN true
        ELSE
            RETURN false
        END IF ELSE
    END FUNCTION

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.
    
    function locateEntry(entry) {
        for (var i=0; i < phonebook.length; i++) {
            if (phonebook[i] === entry) {
                console.log("Entry " + entry + " at index " + i);
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
